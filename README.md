### What this project uses

### How it functions
   * The application renders images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

   * The application keeps track of user's score. 
      * The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time.
      * The user's score is reset to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once.

   * Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

   * After an incorrect guess, the user's score is reset and the game restarts.
